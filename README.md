# Project22
100 Days of Swift (Project 22) "Apple introduced iBeacon technology with iOS 7, and it helped make the Internet of Things hypefest even more stratospheric." In this project, I learned to detect and range beacons, and ask the user for their location. Within the course of this project, I learned about Core Location, CLBeaconRegion, and more. In addition, I completed the following challenges: 

-Write code that shows a UIAlertController when your beacon is first detected. Make sure you set a Boolean to say the alert has been shown, so it doesn’t keep appearing.


-Go through two or three other iBeacons in the Detect Beacon app and add their UUIDs to your app, then register all of them with iOS. Now add a second label to the app that shows new text depending on which beacon was located.


-Add a circle to your view, then use animation to scale it up and down depending on the distance from the beacon – try 0.001 for unknown, 0.25 for far, 0.5 for near, and 1.0 for immediate. You can make the circle by adding an image, or by creating a view that’s 256 wide by 256 high then setting its layer.cornerRadius to 128 so that it’s round.
